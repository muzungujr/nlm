AJPP has enabled us to, through small funds, to do a lot of work.</p> <p> </p> <p> Our journal has also grown really very much. We have been indexed on MEDLINE and recently we were indexed on ISI and have an impact factor. And to us that means a lot, quite a lot. It means we are equals, among equals.</p> <p> When we started the journal, really the impetus was having an African journal publishing African material because we were finding it extremely difficult to have our scientific material published in western journals for various reasons. I am really so glad that we are now able to publish like the rest of them. It has been quite difficult, but AJPP has done a lot to help us along the way.</p> <p> Most of our contributors are from the African continent: West Africa, East Africa. But now we are attracting quite a number from the United States, from the UK, from China, from Europe, Turkey, Czechoslovakia, etc. So we have become truly international even though our focus is local. </p> <p> The growth in the number of eyes looking at our journal. We are into millions every year on the website where we are hosted (Bioline). We have over one million people accessing our journal monthly, which is very good. It gives us a lot of visibility, and also credibility, and of course citations. So it is being visible but also being sustainable that has been, to me, the biggest achievement.</p> <p> The initial partnership we had was with the British Medical Journal, and we learned enormously from the BMJ. They are an extremely large journal with a very huge building. For us we are a very small journal in a small building. But we really appreciate their ideas and their suggestions, and we used them to use to the maximum the biggest resource we have in my country. We have two resources. Number one, time. In the world we are equal, all of us have 24 hours a day. So we learned how to utilize that resource, which we don&rsquo;t need to pay for. The second resource was the human resource. So we have a lot of young people, educated people, and we have learned how to utilize them without necessarily paying them salaries, but giving them knowledge and opportunity to show their potential. </p> <p> Loads and loads of people working on so many things.  I don&rsquo;t have any bureaucracy. We have just about ten brains working on everything from typesetting to production. I am editor in chief, but I can do editorial, I can do production work. My colleagues do vice versa. So in a way I think we have learned to use small bureaucracy to do big things. And I think that is an innovation. I think what it shows us is that we can achieve a lot of things by being out of the box, by thinking in a different way, and by being flexible.</p> <p> Now we are in a different age where we can make material accessible on the click of the mouse. That&rsquo;s why I am married to the movement of free access. So if we can publish material and make it available, freely available, then we are training our students, our staff and keeping them up to date and they will be high class scientists and health workers. That&rsquo;s what motivates me.  The only reward we get in this work is to know that the students we are training, the people in Nigeria who are reading our materials, the people in Uganda who are reading our materials, are benefitting, improving their knowledge and therefore improving health care in their countries. That&rsquo;s my motivation. And I want to do it until I have no breath left in me!"</p> </div> </div>\',\'0222_01_0003.jpg\',\'ajjpmalawi\',\'0223_01_0003.jpg\',\'ajjpmali\',\'0219_01_0003.jpg\',\'ajppahs\',\'0220_01_0003.jpg\',\'ajppeth\',\'0192_01_0012.jpg\',\'bandawe\',\'_Ethiopia\',\'<ul> </ul> <span style="font-size: 18px; color: #0070c0;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Ethiopia</span><br /> Strengthening African Medical Journals: <span style="font-size: 18px;">African Journal Partnership Project</span></strong></span><span style="font-size: 18px; color: #0070c0;"> </span><span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong> </strong></span>\',\'5\',\'Ethiopian Journal of Health Sciences\',\'<img height=\\\'363px\\\' src=":0220_01_0003.jpg"/><br /> <div class="nlmText"> <div class="nlmTitle nlmBlue">African Journal Partnership Project: <br /> Ethiopian Journal of Health Sciences, Jimma, Ethiopia<br /> Partnered with Annals of Internal Medicine</div> <p>Accepted into MEDLINE</p> <img height=\\\'300px\\\' src=":0191_01_0012.jpg"/> <p style="font-size: 12px;">Dr. Abraham Hailemlak, Editor</p> <br /> <div style="font-style: italic;"> <p>"With AJPP we developed partnerships.  The Ethiopian Journal of Health Sciences was partnered with Annals of Internal Medicine, a prestigious health study journal, and we learned a lot from them.  Still they are supporting us, guiding us on how to develop the journal further.  The link to our website is posted on the Annals of Internal Medicine website, and also the link for Annals of Internal Medicine is posted on our journal website. So the partnership is so strong and doing very fine.  Additionally, they helped us apply to be a member of the ICMJE, the International Committee for Medical Journal Editors. </p> <p> The other partnership through AJPP is south-south where those from the African side, six journals, work together.  Whenever there is a conference or a workshop, we invite each other to participate. And sometimes we use their people as peer reviewers, and they send us manuscripts for peer review. </p> <p> The biggest accomplishment for the Ethiopian Journal of Health Sciences is being indexed in PubMed and MEDLINE, because this made us one of the best medical journals in Ethiopia.  That visibility has helped us get more international papers from West Africa, like Nigeria, Ghana, and even North Africa, Morocco and Egypt, and other parts of the world, including the United States. Also Germany and from the eastern side, from India, China. We are getting papers from all over the world."</p> </div> </div>\',\'_Ghana\',\'<span style="font-size: 18px; color: #0070c0;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Ghana</span><br /> Strengthening African Medical Journals: <span style="font-size: 18px;">African Journal Partnership Project</span></strong></span> <ul> </ul> <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong> </strong></span>\',\'6\',\'Ghana Medical Journal\',\'<img height=\\\'384px\\\' src=":0221_01_0003.jpg"/><br /> <div class="nlmText"> <div class="nlmTitle nlmBlue">African Journal Partnership Project:<br /> Ghana Medical Journal, Accra, Ghana<br /> Partnered with The Lancet</div> <p>Accepted into MEDLINE</p> <img height=\\\'300px\\\' src=":0194_01_0012.jpg"/><br /> <p style="font-size: 12px;">Dr. David Ofori-Adjei, Editor</p> <br /> <div style="font-style: italic;"> <p>"The resources made available to the journal through AJPP have allowed us to establish an editorial office, to hire support staff, and also to train authors and reviewers. Consequently, in the course of time, we have been able to regain our regular publication [schedule].  Our visibility has gone up, because now we have also managed to get into MEDLINE.</p> <p> In 2011 we were accepted back into MEDLINE, which was one clear end point.  But a more important thing is the role the AJPP played in the process of getting back into MEDLINE through the various activities that we undertook in order to enhance our visibility, improve the quality of submissions to the journal, and provide the resources for us to be able to come out on a regular basis.  All contributed to our getting into MEDLINE. I now consider getting back into MEDLINE as one of our major achievements in the last ten years.</p> <p> The other aspect of being part of AJPP has been the opportunity to meet other African editors of medical journals and to share ideas and learn from each other as we progress our individual journals.</p> <p> My vision for the Ghana Medical Journal is for it not to be only a journal but an educational platform on which you can do other things to help to improve the health of the community, rather than [solely] a focus for academics to publish their work. We have to find other ways of disseminating the scientific information we publish such that the ordinary person will become aware of the changes taking place. </p> <p> Also the journal changing its way of doing business, so that it is not only academic centered but also community oriented, so that we can get interaction with the public as well as from academia. I would like to see the Ghana Medical Journal not only as a journal, but actually as a service, as a means of getting health information available to everybody."</p> </div> </div>\',\'0191_01_0012.jpg\',\'hailemlak\',\'0193_01_0012.jpg\',\'kachimba\',\'0221_01_0003.jpg\',\'lancet\',\'_Malawi\',\'<span style="font-size: 18px; color: #0070c0;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Malawi</span><br /> Strengthening African Medical Journals: <span style="font-size: 18px;">African Journal Partnership Project</span></strong></span> <ul> </ul> <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong> </strong></span>\',\'1\',\'Malawi Medical Journal\',\'<img height=\\\'394px\\\' src=":0222_01_0003.jpg"/><br /> <div class="nlmText"> <div class="nlmTitle nlmBlue">African Journal Partnership Project: <br /> Malawi Medical Journal, Blantyre, Malawi<br /> Partnered with the Journal of the American Medical Association</div> <p>Accepted into MEDLINE</p> <img height=\\\'300px\\\' src=":0192_01_0012.jpg"/> <p style="font-size: 12px;">Dr. Chiwoza Bandawe, Editor</p> <br /> <div style="font-style: italic;"> <p>"The AJPP has really been a lifeline for the Malawi Medical Journal.</p> <p> AJPP is like a family of professionals wanting to get the information out there. But it is not just about us.  It is a huge responsibility that we have to provide an environment, in my case in Malawi, where the academicians and researchers have an outlet that is reliable, that is strong, that is professional and that can stand up internationally.</p> <p> The Malawi Medical Journal is partnered with JAMA, the Journal of the American Medical Association. Through that link with JAMA we have managed to travel over to Chicago and spend some time seeing how a well organized, professional, long standing journal operates. And we have been able to have discussions and input and suggestions about our layout, about our web design, about introducing different sections to our journal. So the week we spent there was very informative and it really inspired and gave us a lot of fresh ideas.</p> <p> The AJPP has been the breath of fresh air that the Malawi Medical Journal really needed, and it has managed to get us to an international standard that we are proud of.</p> <p> I see the Malawi Medical Journal as inspiring people to professional academic excellence in terms of research output.   I remember a graduation ceremony where the Vice Chancellor was speaking and the president of the country was present.  The Vice Chancellor mentioned that the Malawi Medical Journal is now an accredited journal and is of international standard.  As a result of that, all submissions to the Malawi Medical Journal accounted towards promotion. I think that&rsquo;s a great achievement."</p> </div> </div>\',\'_Mali\',\'<span style="font-size: 18px; color: #0070c0;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Mali</span><br /> Strengthening African Medical Journals: <span style="font-size: 18px;">African Journal Partnership Project</span></strong></span> <ul> </ul> <span style="font-size: 18px; color: #0070c0;"> <strong> </strong></span>\',\'3\',\'Mali Medical Journal\',\'<img height=\\\'330px\\\' src=":0223_01_0003.jpg"/><br /> <div class="nlmText"> <div class="nlmTitle nlmBlue">African Journal Partnership Project:<br /> Mali Medical Journal, Bamako, Mali<br /> Partnered with Environmental Health Perspectives</div> <p>Accepted into MEDLINE</p> <img height=\\\'300px\\\' src=":0195_01_0012.jpg"/> <p style="font-size: 12px;">Dr. Siaka Sidibe, Editor</p> </div>\',\'4\',\'Medical Journal of Zambia\',\'<img height=\\\'426px\\\' src=":0224_01_0003.jpg"/><br /> <div class="nlmText"> <div class="nlmTitle nlmBlue">African Journal Partnership Project:<br /> Medical Journal of Zambia, Lusaka, Zambia<br /> Partnered with New England Journal of Medicine</div> <img height=\\\'300px\\\' src=":0193_01_0012.jpg"/> <p style="font-size: 12px;">Dr. John Kachimba, Editor</p> </div>\',\'0224_01_0003.jpg\',\'nejm\',\'0194_01_0012.jpg\',\'ofori\',\'H56\',\'Return\',\'<a href="javascript:maClient.goToPage(\\\'page6.htm\\\',null);" title="return to previous page">return to previous page</a>\',\'0195_01_0012.jpg\',\'sidibe\',\'0190_01_0012.jpg\',\'tumwine\',\'_Uganda\',\'<span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong><span style="font-size: 18px; color: #0070c0;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Uganda</span><br /> Strengthening African Medical Journals: <span style="font-size: 18px;">African Journal Partnership Project</span></strong></span></strong></span>\',\'_Zambia\',\'<ul> </ul> <span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-size: 18px;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000;">Zambia</span><br /> <strong style="color: #0070c0;"> Strengthening African Medical Journals: </strong><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong style="color: #0070c0;">African Journal Partnership Project</strong><br /> <br style="font-size: large;" /> <br style="font-size: large;" /> <br /> </span></span><strong><span style="font-size: 16px; color: #953734;"></span></strong></span> <ul> </ul>\',\'researchers\',\'students\',\'videos\',\'datasheet5\',\'creditsvideo\'],');
