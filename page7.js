The program engaged participants from five Ethiopian universities in Addis Ababa, Debub, Mekelle, Jimma, and Gondor;  the World Bank; NLM staff; and a former NLM Associate from Zambia for three days of training at the Ethiopian Civil Service College/Global Distance Learning Center in Addis Ababa.  The US Embassy in Addis hosted a reception prior to the workshop.

In contrast to the natural landscape, the telecommunications terrain of the early 90s would be barely recognizable today.  No cell phones, no Internet whatsoever, poor telephone service, - all in a country beginning to recover from tumultuous times.  </p>             <p>             Sara was a pioneer, determined and committed to the task at hand and to her future in the country&rsquo;s rebuilding.  At Albert Cook Library, she had learned how to operate SatelLife&rsquo;s ground station which comprised a personal computer, a &ldquo;ham&rdquo; radio, and a modem that allowed these two machines to talk with one another.  When SatelLife&rsquo;s small satellite was overhead daily, one antenna would bring down electronic messages and the other would send those waiting in the queue.  That is, this would happen if everything worked properly!  It was a rather crude setup by today&rsquo;s standards, but it was a critical beginning.  </p>             </td>             <td style="vertical-align: top;"><img src=":0234_01_0003.jpg"/></td>         </tr>     </tbody> </table> <p> A very young Sara picked us up at the airport and took us to Albert Cook Library and the ground station, enclosed in a cage, specially built for security purposes. As station operator, she made sure that messages got to the people for whom they were intended, and that messages from those on the ground got uploaded and sent in a timely fashion.  Once a week, the satellite would deliver HealthNet News which Sara then printed and distributed to researchers, faculty, and students.  (Although the low earth orbit satellite has long since been displaced by far more sophisticated technology, HealthNet News has lived on due to the efforts of Sara.)</p> <p> At this juncture, Sara decided she wanted to be a librarian and set her mind to making that happen.  She got a job at the Ugandan Revenue Authority, so she could earn the necessary funds to go to university.  She completed her undergraduate degree and worked in the Makerere University Library under the tutelage of Dr. Maria Musoke.  </p> <p> Much later, in 2007, when I came to live in Uganda in as a Fulbright Scholar, a tall sophisticated well-dressed woman sought me out.  &ldquo;Julia,&rdquo; she said, softly, &ldquo;I am Sara.&rdquo;  It was indeed Sara, sent back to Albert Cook Library by her mentor &ldquo;Dr. Maria&rdquo; to work with me while I was in residence at the Medical School.   Sara now had one degree under her belt and a wealth of experience.  She was ready to index theses,; train all levels of medical students, researchers, and even journalists; travel to remote sites on uncomfortable buses &ndash; anything to fulfill her dream of working (and, I might say, redefining) the role of medical librarian in subSaharan Africa.</p> <p> When she came to the US for a training course in the fall of 2008, she visited us at the National Library of Medicine.  It was wonderful to finally have her on site.  At the meeting of NLM&rsquo;s Board of Regents, I concluded a presentation on our programs in Africa with this thought:  What keeps me engaged for the long haul in this work is my wonderful colleagues in Africa.  After all, the product of any capacity building is people!  I then gave an example of a spunky teenager who ran a ground station in the early 90s and who has since become an experienced librarian.  At this point, I asked Sara to stand.  It was a lovely moment. </p> <p> Last year, she began a Masters program at Makerere, understanding that this credential would allow her to qualify for NLM&rsquo;s Associate Fellow Program.  She was bravely juggling motherhood, school, work, and information outreach.  Often tired but undaunted, her faith and belief in what she was doing kept her going.   She was an integral part of the NLM Network of African Medical Librarians and Deans which just recently produced an online course entitled Finding, Organizing, and Using Medical Information.  She served on the advisory board of African Health Sciences.</p> <p> I will sorely miss Sara and am not untouched by the irony of her untimely exit from disease as she pursued health for all.  I loved her straightforwardness, her gentle style, her honesty, generosity, grace, and humor which could be wicked!   I loved her devotion to her daughter Saison who has already begun having dreams of her own.</p> <p> Sara&rsquo;s is not a splashy story of dramatic scientific discovery but one of quiet service, persistence, loyalty, and vision of how a medical librarian could provide the information infrastructure for biomedical research and better health in Uganda.</p> <p> Julia Royall<br /> Chief, International Programs<br /> U.S. National Library of Medicine<br /> 11 July 2011</p> </div>\',\'_Uganda\',\'_Zambia\',\'_Zimbabwe\',\'journals\',\'researchers\',\'students\',\'videos\',\'datasheet5\',\'creditsvideo\'],');
